                <p class="p4 text-justify">Century, Inc. has been offering the original “green” building product for more than 40 years: wood. Today we offer extensive lines of wood and wood-based materials for all types of wall, millwork, cabinetry and specialty applications. You will learn more about these in the product pages, including SanFoot and SanPly natural wood veneer sheets which are available in a large variety of species, cuts and configurations. This website has been developed to introduce you to our Environment Friendly® products and how they are used to create exciting and unique interiors. Familiarize yourself with the images of wood species and the surprising palette of colors. Visit our photo gallery and see how SanFoot and SanPly have been used to realize the creative visions of others. The Technical Reference and Specifications/Installation pages will answer many of your questions, or contact us for the nearest distributor, or to have a Jacaranda representative contact you.</p>
                <p class="p4 text-justify">In the early 1970’s, our founder Dan Whittelsey, Sr., was working for Exxon when he saw an opportunity to export veneer quality logs out of Central America. This region exported large quantities of “stickwood” – dimensioned lumber – but rarely whole logs. The exotic species Whittelsey offered were exactly what the Japanese company, Hokusan, was looking for. Logs were sent to Japan, and in return, Dan brought Hokusan’s “fancy face” plywood and exotic sheet veneer back to the United States. The success of this venture soon inspired Mr. Whittelsey and the founders of Hokusan to form a partnership in 1984. They named the company Jacaranda – the Brazilian word for Rosewood. Since the first exchange of logs for finished products, Jacaranda and Hokusan have continued to develop materials to maximize the yield of every log. Today, SanFoot and SanPly lead the industry for natural wood veneer sheet products.</p>
